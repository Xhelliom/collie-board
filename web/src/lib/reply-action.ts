// The free-text reply path's race guard.
//
// Every OTHER path that types into a live TUI (prompt-, wizard-, preview-action) refuses to send a
// key it hasn't first verified the pane is ready for — "Enter is never sent blind". The reply path
// was the one exception: it typed the text, waited a fixed 350ms, and fired the submit key with
// nothing checking what was on screen.
//
// That is issue #34, reproduced on a real pane: with a Claude permission dialog focused, the typed
// text is swallowed and the submit key ANSWERS THE DIALOG — approving whatever option was
// highlighted (Claude highlights "Yes" by default). The message is destroyed and the bridge still
// reports {ok:true}, because both Herdr RPCs genuinely succeeded: an ack means "herdr took the
// bytes" (HERDR_API.md), never "the TUI acted on them". So the bridge cannot detect this; only a
// client that can read the input box can.
//
// The fix makes the submit key CONDITIONAL on evidence the text reached the input box: type
// unsubmitted → poll fresh reads until the adapter sees our text on the "❯" line → only then
// submit. If it never appears, NO key is sent and the caller keeps the draft. This is the same
// choreography submitPreviewNote already uses for the note field, applied to the main input.
